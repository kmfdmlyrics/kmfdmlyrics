Give me
Your dirty love
Give me
Your dirty love

I'm obsessed and derranged
For I am destined to rule
And i just can't believe that you are such a fool
I don't need your sweet devotion
I don't want your cheap emotion
You will do as you are told
'till the rights to you are sold
Once you were my one and only
Took my stash and left me lonely
Don't you blow your top
are you hung up

Give me
Your dirty love
