My uncle Sammy he's meek and mild
He took a sausage from my child
When the child began to cry
Sammy kicked him in the eye
Sixteen troubles and on my own
It really starts when I take him home
No meat, no man
No meat, no man

No man's got a heavenly treat
Like the smooth hot meaning of a piece of meat
No meat, no man
No meat, no man

Sixteen rabbits on my neck
Uncle Sammy you can bet
No meat, no man
No meat, no man

Now you slip and slide
Watch my perfect stride

Sex of the best
A seven ton truck
I'm eight miles high
A ticket to ride
No meat, no man
No meat, no man

I took my girlfriend out tonight
But we got drunk and had a fight
No meat, no man
No meat, no man

I got sixteen rabbits for president
I bet my geld on their success
But they don't rent
No meat, no man
No meat, no man

A new political strategy
Oh that's nice
Confusions rise
No meat, no man
No meat, no man
And that's all
